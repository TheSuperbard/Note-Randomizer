# Note-Randomizer
A project in Logic Pro X Scripter (JavaScript) to assign random values per note and keep them.
This differs from the randomizer in that that changes with every note pressed, so for example, this will keep the same random values for four Cs in a row.

It can be assigned to pitch bend, polyphonic aftertouch or a cc channel.

For more information on Logic Pro X's scripter, please see https://support.apple.com/kb/PH26956?locale=en_GB. To use this code, open scripter, click 'Open Script in Editor', paste in Script.js from here, then hit Run Script.

Thoughts/extensions appreciated.

Please, use, change and adapt and let me know how you get on!

# Note-Randomizer
A project in Logic Pro X Scripter (JavaScript) to assign random values per note and keep them.
This differs from the randomizer in that that changes with every note pressed, so for example, this will keep the same random values for four Cs in a row.

It can be assigned to pitch bend, polyphonic aftertouch or a cc channel.

Thoughts/extensions appreciated.

Please, use, change and adapt and let me know how you get on!
